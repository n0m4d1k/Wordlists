# Wordlist README

## Description

This is a collection of wordlists I have either created or that I have found useful.

### DanesCustomFuzzingList

This List has it all so you can fuzz ever part of an HTTP request including dirs, files, HTTP Verbs, JSON, and headers. (8250 Payloads)

### DanesCustomFuzzingListShort

This list has the HTTP Verbs, dirs and file names removed for quicker fuzzing. (3378 Payloads)

### DanesCustomFuzzingListShorter

This list has the HTTP Verbs, Headers, dirs and file names removed. I also removed the incremented fuzzing for SQLI and large strings and just left the largest strings and the first iteration of SQLI. (2125 Payloads)
